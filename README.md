#Site Purpose 

My final project for Industrial Design was left open ended.  Each member of the class was assigned to design anything he/she wanted, as long as it was three-dimensional.  I have always been interested in creating inspiration boards and color schemes, specifically in regards to interior design and event planning.  This past summer, I got a job working at Pier One Imports, a housewares retailer.  For these reasons, I decided to design a color scheme, glassware and place setting for a dinner party based on inspiration that I had gathered from a variety of sources.  This website collates all of my inspiration in one place.



##Media Query Breakpoints and 3 Column layout

Layout changes most visibly on pages 2 and 3 (Color Scheme and Glassware).  They have a three column layout at desktop and tablet size, but the columns are considerably scaled down at tablet size so that they entire layout can fit on the screen.  At mobile size, both pages display all images in a single column.  



##CSS Animation on Continuous Loop

On the home page, a sunflower bounces back and forth horizontally just under the navigation.



##CSS Animation on User Interaction

Color of links changes when the user mouses over them and when they are clicked.



##Background Image

Same image of girl in sunflower field scaled on all three pages.  



##Visual JQUery Interaction

On page 3 (Glassware), user has the option to add ideas to a list of inspiration by entering them in the text box and clicking the "Add it!" button.
